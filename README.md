# LinuxProtonGameFixes
A repo of a few custom scripts I made to get some games working with proton. All scripts were tested on Proton 4.11-6 with wine v4.16.

READ THESE FIRST BEFORE USING!
1. WARNING! These scripts come with absolutely no warranty and while doing this is normally safe you still agree that by using them it is entirely your fault if you screw up your system!
2. All scripts should be placed before executing/running in your for your "steamapps/compatdata/" directory otherwise they will not work!
3. As a general rule, games should be launched (allbeit unsuccessfully) initially in order to initialize the wine/proton prefix directory for the scripts to work.

I created these scripts in my spare time to help steamline some of the less cooperative games that work on proton but require a bit of tweaking to do so first. To use these you will need at least a basic understanding of how to use a Unix terminal (and more specifically bash), including how to set permissions and execute shell scripts.

You will also need wine and winetricks installed.

Any helpful comments/suggestions welcome!

Thankyou to everyone on ProtonDB for underlying fixes.
